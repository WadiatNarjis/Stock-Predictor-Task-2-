Apple Stock Price Predictor
📝 Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the next day’s closing price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock using a simple machine learning model called Linear Regression. 
It helps us understand how data from the past can be used to make smart guesses about the future.
📚 Purpose of the Project
The main purpose of this project is to:
Show how we can use past stock data to predict future values
Learn how machine learning can be applied to real-life financial data
Build a beginner-level tool that connects data, prediction, and visualization
🧠 What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is a basic method used in machine learning to find a relationship between two things. In this case, it finds how today’s closing price affects tomorrow’s price. It draws a straight line that fits the data and uses it to predict future values.
🔍 How the Project Works
Collect Data:
We use real stock prices of Apple from 2010 to 2024. The data is taken from Yahoo Finance using Python.
Prepare the Data:
We arrange the data so that the model can learn the link between today’s price and the next day’s price.
Train the Model:
The Linear Regression model studies the data and tries to find a pattern.
Make Predictions:
When a date is entered, the model predicts the price for the next day.
Compare with Actual Price:
If the actual price is known, it is shown along with the predicted price.
Graph the Results:
A line graph is created to compare predicted and actual values in a visual way.
🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
Python – Programming language used

pandas – For handling the stock data

yfinance – To download Apple’s stock prices

scikit-learn – To build the Linear Regression model

matplotlib – To draw graphs for predictions

📈 What the Graph Shows
The graph makes it easier to understand how good or bad the predictions are. 
You can clearly see where the prediction is close to the actual value and where it is not.
It helps users trust or improve the model.
🎓 What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:
How to collect and clean stock market data
How to use Linear Regression for prediction
How to show results using graphs
How real-world problems can be solved using code and tools.

📉 Limitations of the Project
While this project gives a basic understanding of prediction using machine learning, it has some limitations:
Simplicity of the Model: Linear Regression is a very simple method. Stock prices depend on many factors (news, economy, company performance), 
so a simple model may not always give accurate results.
Only One Feature Used: This model uses only one feature — the closing price — while many other factors could improve the prediction.
Real Market is Unpredictable: The stock market is influenced by sudden events which cannot be predicted using past data only.
🚧 Challenges Faced
While completing this project, I faced a few challenges:
Understanding Data Shapes: Preparing the input data in the correct format for training the model required attention.
Handling Date Formats: Matching prediction dates with actual prices required careful date processing.
Interpreting Graphs: Making sure the graph clearly shows useful information was an important step.
🧾 Conclusion
In conclusion, this project was a great opportunity to understand how machine learning can be used to make predictions using real-world data. 
I learned the full process — from collecting stock data to making predictions and visualizing results.
Though simple, this model serves as a good starting point for more advanced financial data projects.
